Final graphics project

GPU lightning simulation

My final graphics project is another gpu programming project. It simulates a lighting arc by drawing a horizontal sine wave, adding random noise to it, and repeating this effect
recursively (with reduced a reduced thickness factor) up to the user defined arc limit. User can control arc color (yellow, green, red, blue, purple, rainbow), speed, number of
arcs, and toggle a mouse magnatism effect that causes the arcs to pull towards mouse location with strength inversely proportional to distance from mouse location. These settings
can be controlled by the secondary window that opens with main application

The application does not come precompiled. To run the application, you will need to open the visual studio solution and run it from there.
